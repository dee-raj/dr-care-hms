      What Are Medicines?
   </h1>
   <p>
      Medicines are chemicals or compounds used to cure, halt, or prevent disease; ease symptoms; or help in the
      diagnosis of illnesses. Advances in medicines have enabled doctors to cure many diseases and save lives.
   </p>

   <p>
      These days, medicines come from a variety of sources. Many were developed from substances found in nature, and
      even today many are extracted from plants.
   </p>

   <p>
      Some medicines are made in labs by mixing together a number of chemicals. Others, like penicillin, are byproducts
      of organisms such as fungus. And a few are even biologically engineered by inserting genes into bacteria that make
      them produce the desired substance.
   </p>

   <h2>
      Different Types of Medicines
   </h2>
   <p>
      Medicines act in a variety of ways. Some can cure an illness by killing or halting the spread of invading germs,
      such as bacteria and viruses. Others are used to treat cancer by killing cells as they divide or preventing them
      from multiplying. Some drugs replace missing substances or correct low levels of natural body chemicals such as
      some hormones or vitamins. Medicines can even affect parts of the nervous system that control a body process.
   </p>

   <p>
      Nearly everyone has taken an antibiotic. This type of medicine fights bacterial infections. Your doctor may
      prescribe an antibiotic for things like strep throat or an ear infection. Antibiotics work either by killing
      bacteria or halting their multiplication so that the body's immune system can fight off the infection.
   </p>

   <p>
      Sometimes a part of the body can't make enough of a chemical. That can also make you sick. Someone with
      insulin-dependent diabetes, for instance, has a pancreas that can't produce enough insulin (a hormone that
      regulates glucose in the body). Some people have a low production of thyroid hormone, which helps control how the
      body uses energy. In each case, doctors can prescribe medicines to replace the missing hormone.

      Pros and Cons of Prescription Medicine

   <p>
      If the FDA considers a medication safe enough to approve, that means its benefits outweigh its known risks. The
      medications you take play an important role in your overall health. However, all medications have possible side
      effects, warnings, and drug interactions, so it's important to understand your treatments, expected results, and
      alternative medical options.
